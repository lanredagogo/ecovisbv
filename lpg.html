                  <div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a versatile, clean-burning fuel that consists of hydrocarbon gases, primarily propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀). When extracted from natural gas processing and oil refining, these gases are liquefied under pressure for easy storage and transportation. LPG is widely used as a fuel for heating, cooking, automotive engines, industrial applications, and even as a refrigerant. Due to its portability, efficiency, and lower emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels, LPG is a popular energy source globally.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-[2.3rem]  font-bold mb-4">What is LPG?</h2>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        LPG is produced from two key sources: during the refining of crude oil and from natural gas processing. The extracted gases are compressed and cooled into a liquid form, which significantly reduces their volume, making LPG highly transportable. LPG returns to its gaseous state when released from its pressurized container, which makes it easy to use in various applications.

                        The flexibility of LPG is one of its greatest advantages, as it can be stored in cylinders or tanks, transported by trucks or ships, and used in areas without access to pipelines or other energy infrastructure.
