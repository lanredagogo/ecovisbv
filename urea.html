                </h2>
                  <div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Urea, also known as carbamide, is a nitrogen-rich compound used extensively as a fertilizer in agriculture and in various industrial applications. Its high nitrogen content, typically around 46%, makes it one of the most concentrated nitrogen fertilizers available on the market. Urea is highly soluble in water, which allows it to be easily absorbed by plants, promoting growth and enhancing crop yields. Additionally, it is used in industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing.

                    <div>
                      <p class="mb-4">
                        Urea is an organic compound that occurs naturally in the human body as a waste product from the breakdown of proteins. Industrially, urea is synthesized from ammonia and carbon dioxide in a process called the Haber-Bosch process. The result is a white, crystalline solid that is highly effective in providing the nitrogen that plants need for growth and development.</p>
                      <p>Urea is non-toxic and environmentally friendly when applied appropriately, making it the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer globally. Besides its agricultural uses, urea has several industrial applications, including in the production of plastics, resins, and as an additive in diesel exhaust systems to reduce emissions.</p>
